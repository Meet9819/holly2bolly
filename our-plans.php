							<p>Creation of extensive data base is the first step taken by us.</p>

							<p>Data of artists, cameramen, technicians, musicians, singers, directors and all the categories of film making personnel, apart from the production, distribution, exhibition, publicity, recording and shooting studios, cinemas and other business houses and organisations is essential for any activity relating to films and serials.</p>

							<p>The dubbing of original films into various languages and sub-titling will be undertaken on commercial basis.</p>

							<p>Marketing of films will be a specialised job. The promotions and events of the client's films all over India and abroad through our network will be our key activities. International marketing of clients' films will be a thrust area with our privileged network created over the past few years.</p>

							<p>Production of films on commercial basis will be a major business of the organisation. This will include commercial films, short films, ad films, CSR films, social awareness films, Corporate Show reels, Serials, etc.</p>

							<p>Syndication of serials for various client channels.</p>

							<p>Like the concept of backward integration in manufacturing industries, we will link the needs of the user organisations with the services of the stalwarts and aspirants in the entertainment industry.</p>

							<p>In the present time of outsourcing, we render services to production houses. The services include surveying, marketing, events management, distribution, syndication, dubbing, sub-titling etc..</p>

							<p>Over the several generations, it is proved that in the film industry, only the people with dedication, perseverance, talent and exposure have succeeded. Only merits can guarantee success in the film industry. Therefore, we also conduct some activities aimed at improvement of their performance, to build and strengthen their merits.</p>

							<p>Several other areas of films and serials business are under consideration.</p>

							<p>Seminars, work shops, talks, shows, critical appreciation and interactive events will be conducted to bring the members on common platform and to develop fellowship among them.</p>

							<p>Over the several generations, it is proved that in the film industry, only the people with dedication, perseverance, talent and exposure have succeeded. Only merits can guarantee success in the film industry. Therefore, we will also conduct some activities aimed at improvement of their performance, the focus will be to build and strengthen their merits.</p>

							<p>We will conduct training sessions, offer exposure to commercial film world, produce films and serials, convey their availability to the film makers and render various services to strengthen their careers in the film industry. However, it must be well understood that our training will be refinement and improvement over what you can already do now. It can not be a substitute to full-fledged training like FTII etc.</p>

							<p>Production of films and serials of all types by the members, of the members and for the members will be core activity for exposure and careers of the members. This will include commercial films, short films, ad films, CSR films, social awareness films, Corporate Show reels, Serials, etc.</p>

							<p>The promotions and events of the members' films will be undertaken through our network. This will include, wherever possible, International marketing.</p>

							<p>In all our activities, prompt and competitive results will be the benchmark of our organisation.</p>

							<p>The well settled artists, technicians, directors and film houses will be roped in for the support of the budding aspirants.</p>

							<p>It will only be fair to expect from the members in turn to render help, support and assistance to the fellow members of the organisation when they succeed.</p>

							<p>The non-commercial activities of the organisation will not be guided by profit motive. But the benefit of the members will be the main objective in such activities.</p>

							<p>However, the commercial activities like syndication, distribution, promotion, marketing etc. of the members will be based on the commercial principles and viability factors.</p>
